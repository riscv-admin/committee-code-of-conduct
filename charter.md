# RISC-V Code of Conduct Committee Charter

## Mission
Our mission is creating and maintaining a safe and respectful community by fostering collaboration, mentorship, and amity. This committee will provide feedback to community members based on the [Code of Conduct](https://riscv.org/community/community-code-of-conduct/) in order to meet the goals of that policy by adhering to an approved process. The committeeâ€™s actions should reflect the community that it serves, and as such, we will continually improve our process as needed.

## Contacting the committee
The committee maintains a private mailing list for reporting incidents, asking questions, and internal committee communication. To contact the committee please email conduct@riscv.org for any confidential matters.

## Scope
The committee is responsible for overseeing conduct issues in the following areas:
- RISC-V Mailing Lists
- RISC-V GitHub Repositories
- RISC-V Documentation & Wiki

## Committee Operation
The committee strives to respond quickly to reports, as well as initiate whatever actions are appropriate. In some cases, this may require the committee to take some action such as removing a GitHub comment, deleting a Slack message, or removing someone from a mailing list. The committee, however, will retroactively review any action taken in such instances to ensure it was appropriate.

## Incident Report Confidentiality
The committee will keep all reports confidential and will only share the report information with RISC-V leadership if they believe doing so is
appropriate.

## Incident Response Recusal
A member of the Code of Conduct committee will recuse themselves from evaluating and responding to any incident for which they are unable to be impartial.
